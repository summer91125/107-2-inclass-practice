## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
library(stringr)
```

```{r}
course <- c("個體經濟學","投資學","總體經濟學")
course
str_subset(course,"經濟學")
str_detect(course,"經濟學")
```
```{r}
studentID<-c(
  '410177115','410176080','410174233','410177011','410182045','410176014')
studentID
major <- str_sub(studentID,5,6)
major
入學年 <- str_sub(studentID,2,4)
入學年
```
```{r}
month <- c("1","3","5")
